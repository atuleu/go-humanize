# go-humanize an humanization library


Yes, I know https://github.com/dustin/go-humanize exists. However I do
not like its implementation for duration, as you path a time and not a
duration.

There are far less stuff in this repos, it is just my private package
made in a few minutes, in order to avoid to duplicate code in other
projects.

Use it if you want, but if your jobs or others jobs depends on it, you
should probably not.
